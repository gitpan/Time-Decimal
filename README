The Babyloninan 24 hour clock is one of the last complicated vestiges of the
pre-decimal age.  The french revolution, when it created decimal measures for
everything, also invented a division of the day into ten hours of 100 minutes
and again 100 seconds each.  The advantage is that seconds and minutes are
roughly as long as those we know.  Hours are of course more than twice as long.
